Hi, I'm Arjun, and I turn messy data into meaningful insights — kind of like a magician, but with dashboards instead of a top hat.

Welcome to my data playground! This repository is a collection of projects where I slice, dice, and visualize data to uncover insights, answer questions, and tell compelling stories. If Excel sheets and SQL queries had a party, this is where it would be hosted.

My Technical Skills

Business Intelligence: Power BI, Tableau

Data Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL

Data Visualization and Reporting

Statistical Analysis

Excel (Advanced)
